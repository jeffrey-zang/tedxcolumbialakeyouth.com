      <div>
        Quantum information science uses ideas from quantum mechanics and
        applies them to information technologies, with new paradigms for
        computing, communication, and sensing being made possible because of it.
        But how can we give students the opportunity to engage with ideas from
        the quantum realm? We'll discuss some of the potential impacts of
        quantum science and the ways researchers with a variety of backgrounds
        contribute the field, as well as how we help introduce students and
        teachers to the topic.

      <div>
        Milind Kumar, a 2nd-year engineering student at the University of
        Waterloo, carries a unique story. All was well going into his teenage
        years, but then things took an unexpected turn when he was suddenly
        diagnosed with leukemia. It was a moment that had him rethink his entire
        existence, causing him to go into a tailspin. Through the ups and downs
        of a 3+ year treatment plan, from moments of hopelessness to moments of
        sheer joy and everything in between, Milind victoriously rang his
        end-of-treatment bell in December of 2022. It was a journey that taught
        him so much about what it means to be resilient and embrace challenges
        head-on. Milind has since been committed to sharing his experience and
        lessons learned with others through heartfelt blogs and presentations,
        which have opened a window into his world and shed light on the
        challenges faced by childhood cancer patients. His talk will be centred
        around the transformative power of learning to overcome and grow from
        life's grandest challenges.

        are in need of innovative solutions. In her talk, Katelyn explores the
        root issues surrounding braille education, and debunks the common

    description: (
      <div>
        Young minds possess immense potential for scientific-humanitarian
        progress, waiting to be unlocked by the right teaching methodologies. AI
        catalyzes this progress - it marks a paradigm shift in the way our youth
        will work, innovate, and solve millions of critical societal problems.
        Yet, an acute dichotomy exists – the generation that can best use these
        tools to drive solutions also understand them the least. This talk
        presents the AI education dilemma – the missing pillar that, if
        established, can skyrocket AI-driven impact. Lessons from ISEF, building
        AI educational tools with Dr. Touretsky of Carnegie Mellon University,
        and developing curriculum handbooks with ReadyAI are compiled to reveal
        the solution: unifying foundational principles and intuition-driven
        tinkering.

        When someone says “education”, you probably think of a school or
        university. However, some of our most valuable learning happens outside
        of the classroom — and in 2023, these experiences are often what shape
        our success. Developer educator Jacklyn Biggin shares how practical
        experiences such as hackathons can fill in gaps not just in resumes, but
        in life experience too.

    description: (
      <div>
        When it comes to preparing our students for the future, what is the most
        important thing? In this talk, educator Steve Bryson will suggest that
        the intentional teaching of good character may be the most important
        skill we can pass on and why this often overlooked, or by-product of a
        good education, needs to be taught more intentionally. He’ll look at
        character education as a whole, why it is so difficult to explicitly
        teach ideas such as grit or perseverance, and how effectively teaching
        these skills can have an incredible impact on our students. By the end
        of the talk, you’ll have a stronger appreciation for this concept and
        know that when it comes to preparing our students for their future:
        Character Counts!

        29 million Americans will have an eating disorder in their lifetime.
        Doctors show a lack of willingness to see fat patients. This speech
        illuminates the grim truth underlying our society: its pervasive
        fatphobic culture. By showing us the consequences of weight bias in
        areas such as employment and healthcare, while interweaving her own
        story, a personal and powerful account of her experience with an eating
        disorder, Elaine reveals the terror of our societal norms. She moves us
        to take action against this collective concern and shares how we, as
        individuals, can make a difference—and each pull our own weight.

        Following the theme of reinventing education, I will address the lack of
        emphasis on teaching students how to take initiative in the current
        education system. My talk will explain how traditional education focuses
        on imparting knowledge and following instructions while forgetting the
        essential skill of self-driven action. I will also explain how I drew
        knowledge from my family and community to launch my own initiative and
        tackle a growing education disparity amidst virtual learning. Through
        this, I return to the theme and display learning in different ways while
        working towards a larger issue.
