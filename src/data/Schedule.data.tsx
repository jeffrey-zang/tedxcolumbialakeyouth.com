    description: <div>Classroom-based education can provide a grounding for core concepts, but is unlikely to help you become a master in your craft, nor explore which topics you'd truly like to deep dive into. In this talk, I'll discuss how students can reinvent their own education to better prepare themselves for the ""real world"" and kickstart their post-education careers.

    Themes include hackathons, the importance of ""doing"", and how post-pandemic young people have all the tools they need to take control over their own education. Grades are important, but being able to do cool things is so much more important.</div>

In this talk, educator Steve Bryson will suggest that the intentional teaching of good character may be the most important skill we can pass on and why this often overlooked, or by-product of a good education, needs to be taught more intentionally. He’ll look at character education as a whole, why it is so difficult to explicitly teach ideas such as grit or perseverance, and how effectively teaching these skills can have an incredible impact on our students. By the end of the talk, you’ll have a stronger appreciation for this concept and know that when it comes to preparing our students for their future: Character Counts!</div>

This speech illuminates the grim truth underlying our society: its pervasive fatphobic culture. By showing us the consequences of weight bias in areas such as employment and healthcare, while interweaving her own story, a personal and powerful account of her experience with an eating disorder, Elaine reveals the terror of our societal norms. She moves us to take action against this collective concern and shares how we, as individuals, can make a difference—and each pull our own weight.</div>

In this workshop, we'll take a closer look at quantum cryptography, which uses quantum superposition and the uncertainty principle to keep information secure. You'll get a chance to see how it works both in theory and in practice, and see how these ideas extend to other technologies like quantum computers.</div>

    description: <div>Following the theme of reinventing education, I will address the lack of emphasis on teaching students how to take initiative in the current education system. My talk will explain how traditional education focuses on imparting knowledge and following instructions while forgetting the essential skill of self-driven action. I will also explain how I drew knowledge from my family and community to launch my own initiative and tackle a growing education disparity amidst virtual learning. Through this, I return to the theme and display learning in different ways while working towards a larger issue.</div>
